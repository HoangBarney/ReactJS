<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1½ cups glutinous (sweet) rice</li>
<li>1⅓ cups well-stirred canned unsweetened coconut milk</li>
<li>⅓ cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted lightly</li>
<li>1 large mango, peeled, pitted, and cut into thin slices (at least 24)</li>
    
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>In a bowl wash rice well in several changes of cold water until water is clear. Soak rice in cold water to cover overnight.</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Drain rice well in a sieve. Set sieve over a large deep saucepan of simmering water (sieve should not touch water) and steam rice, covered with a kitchen towel and a lid, 30 to 40 minutes, or until tender (check water level in pan occasionally, adding more water if necessary).</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While rice is cooking, in a small saucepan bring 1 cup coconut milk to a boil with ⅓ cup sugar and salt, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and remove from heat. Keep mixture warm.</p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Transfer cooked rice to a bowl and stir in coconut-milk mixture. Let rice stand, covered, 30 minutes, or until coconut-milk mixture is absorbed. Rice may be prepared up to this point 2 hours ahead and kept covered at room temperature.</p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While rice is standing, in cleaned small pan slowly boil remaining ⅓ cup coconut milk with remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, stirring occasionally, 1 minute. Transfer sauce to a small bowl and chill until cool and thickened slightly.</p>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>To serve, mold ¼ cup servings of sticky rice on dessert plates. Drizzle desserts with sauce and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Divide mango slices among plates.</p>
